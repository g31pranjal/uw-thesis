\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
	\item In chapter~\ref{c:guidelines}, we claimed that each graph has some level of structuredness that should be harnessed. In this thesis, we set our focus on harnessing only the structured segments of the graph data, leaving behind unstructured data. A possible extension to this thesis, could be to explore data structures and techniques that can improve storage and querying of unstructured data.

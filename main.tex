% Setting up the page margins...
% uWaterloo thesis requirements specify a minimum of 1 inch (72pt) margin at the
% top, bottom, and outside page edges and a 1.125 in. (81pt) gutter
% margin (on binding side). While this is not an issue for electronic
% viewing, a PDF may be printed, and so we have the same page layout for
% both printed and electronic versions, we leave the gutter margin in.
% Set margins to minimum permitted by uWaterloo thesis regulations:
\setlength{\marginparwidth}{0pt} % width of margin notes
% N.B. If margin notes are used, you must adjust \textwidth, \marginparwidth
% and \marginparsep so that the space left between the margin notes and page
% edge is less than 15 mm (0.6 in.)
\setlength{\marginparsep}{0pt} % width of space between body text and margin notes
\setlength{\evensidemargin}{0.125in} % Adds 1/8 in. to binding side of all 
% even-numbered pages when the "twoside" printing option is selected
\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{0.125in} % Adds 1/8 in. to the left of all pages
% when "oneside" printing is selected, and to the left of all odd-numbered
% pages when "twoside" printing is selected
\setlength{\textwidth}{6.375in} % assuming US letter paper (8.5 in. x 11 in.) and 
% side margins as above
\raggedbottom

% The following statement specifies the amount of space between
% paragraphs. Other reasonable specifications are \bigskipamount and \smallskipamount.
\setlength{\parskip}{\medskipamount}

% The following statement controls the line spacing.  The default
% spacing corresponds to good typographic conventions and only slight
% changes (e.g., perhaps "1.2"), if any, should be made.
\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1} % this is the default line space setting

% By default, each chapter will start on a recto (right-hand side)
% page.  We also force each section of the front pages to start on 
% a recto page by inserting \cleardoublepage commands.
% In many cases, this will require that the verso page be
% blank and, while it should be counted, a page number should not be
% printed.  The following statements ensure a page number is not
% printed on an otherwise blank verso page.
\let\origdoublepage\cleardoublepage
\newcommand{\clearemptydoublepage}{%
  \clearpage{\pagestyle{empty}\origdoublepage}}
\let\cleardoublepage\clearemptydoublepage

% -----------------------

% The following statement selects the style to use for references.  It controls the sort order of the entries in the bibliography and also the formatting for the in-text labels.
\bibliographystyle{plain}
% This specifies the location of the file containing the bibliographic information.  
% It assumes you're using BibTeX (if not, why not?).
\cleardoublepage % This is needed if the book class is used, to place the anchor in the correct page,
                 % because the bibliography will start on its own page.
                 % Use \clearpage instead if the document class uses the "oneside" argument
\phantomsection  % With hyperref package, enables hyperlinking from the table of contents to bibliography             
% The following statement causes the title "References" to be used for the bibliography section:
\renewcommand*{\bibname}{References}

% Add the References to the Table of Contents
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\textbf{References}}

\bibliography{ref}
% Tip 5: You can create multiple .bib files to organize your references. 
% Just list them all in the \bibliogaphy command, separated by commas (no spaces).

% The following statement causes the specified references to be added to the bibliography% even if they were not 
% cited in the text. The asterisk is a wildcard that causes all entries in the bibliographic database to be included (optional).
\nocite{*}

% The \appendix statement indicates the beginning of the appendices.
\appendix
% Add a title page before the appendices and a line in the Table of Contents

\label{AppendixA}

%======================================================================
\section{Using the GUI}
Properties of Matab plots can be adjusted from the plot window via a graphical interface. Under the Desktop menu in the Figure window, select the Property Editor. You may also want to check the Plot Browser and Figure Palette for more tools. To adjust properties of the axes, look under the Edit menu and select Axes Properties.

To set the figure size and to save as PDF or other file formats, click the Export Setup button in the figure Property Editor.

\section{From the Command Line} 
All figure properties can also be manipulated from the command line. Here's an example: 
\begin{verbatim}
x=[0:0.1:pi];
hold on % Plot multiple traces on one figure
plot(x,sin(x))
plot(x,cos(x),'--r')
plot(x,tan(x),'.-g')
title('Some Trig Functions Over 0 to \pi') % Note LaTeX markup!
legend('{\it sin}(x)','{\it cos}(x)','{\it tan}(x)')
hold off
set(gca,'Ylim',[-3 3]) % Adjust Y limits of "current axes"
set(gcf,'Units','inches') % Set figure size units of "current figure"
set(gcf,'Position',[0,0,6,4]) % Set figure width (6 in.) and height (4 in.)
cd n:\thesis\plots % Select where to save
print -dpdf plot.pdf % Save as PDF
\end{verbatim}

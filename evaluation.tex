In this chapter we evaluate our columnar data structures 


\section{Experimental Setup}

\paragraph{Hardware Setup:}For all our experiments, we use a single machine that has two Intel E5-2670 @2.6GHzCPUs and 512 GB of RAM. The machine has 16 physical cores and 32 logical cores. We only use one logical core. We set the maximum size of the JVM heap to 500 GB and keep JVMâ€™s default minimum size.

\paragraph{Datasets:}We run all our experiments on the synthetic graph data generated from the LDBC SnB

\section{Paged Edge Property Columns}

Paged Edge property Columns allows close-by reads for the propery values of edges of the same-ordered adjacency list. In this section, we quantatively demonstrate the effectiveness of Paged Edge Property Columns over unordered Edge Property Column. In particular, we also demonstrate that our Paged Edge Property Columns are able to
